# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project uses a **Jupyter Notebook** to classify movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** using the **NLTK Movie Reviews dataset**. It demonstrates a simple natural language processing workflow including data loading, text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, model training with Logistic Regression, evaluation, and prediction.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to see:
   - Data loading and preprocessing  
   - Model training and evaluation  
   - Testing predictions on sample reviews  

## Tech Stack
Python, Jupyter Notebook, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas
